Simple application that allows for the recording of different types of
information based on mouse locations. Includes ability to read and store screen
coordinates, color, and angles of shapes on screen. The program isn't perfect,
but it's a nice tool to have and was good practice.

Note that the location of the Coordinates.txt file needs to be changed based on
the personal systems.
